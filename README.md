It's a library for browsing and choosing photos and videos from Android device's gallery.

Key features:

* Select photo and video
* Optionally display bucket (folder) list first. Selecting a bucket/folder, will display all photos/videos inside it. 
* Selected photos will be displayed at selection panel at the bottom. You can unselect the photo directly from that panel.
* Take photo and record video


## How to Use It?
I'll be back!

## Acknowledgement
Initially heavily based on [MediaChooser project](https://github.com/learnNcode/MediaChooser). Along the way, I made many changes regarding UI/UX and some models to encapsulate selected media. I'm using it for an app by my company, [Jepret Story](http://jepret.in/app), so I need to change the packages name. 

I also use:

* [material-menu](https://github.com/balysv/material-menu) for displaying Material Design action menu
* [Android-ObservableScrollView](https://github.com/ksoichiro/Android-ObservableScrollView) for observing scrolling in order to show/hide action bar
